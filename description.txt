2D game that is created by me. The name of the game is “Be quick”. The whole game is played on the window, where size of the game window is static. The main meaning of the game is to avoid enemy squares that are coming from top of the world. In order to play the game you should install "Pygame" platform on your computer. The installation steps of "Pygame" are available in the following webpage "https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted".
